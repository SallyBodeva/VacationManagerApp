Hi there,

To get started with the app, just follow these steps:

1.Open the solution.

2.Go to RentACar.Web.

3.Open appsettings.json.

4.Change the DefaultConnection to match your SSMS Connection string.

5.In the Package Manager Console, type and enter Update-Database (you'll find the full command in a comment at the top of ApplicationDbContext.cs).

6.Finally, run the app from Visual Studio. That's it! You're ready to go!
