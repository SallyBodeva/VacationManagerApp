# VacationManagerApp
Hi there,

To get started with the app, just follow these steps:

Open the solution.
Go to RentACar.Web.
Open appsettings.json.
Change the DefaultConnection to match your SSMS Connection string.
In the Package Manager Console, type and enter Update-Database (you'll find the full command in a comment at the top of ApplicationDbContext.cs).
Finally, run the app from Visual Studio. That's it! You're ready to go!
